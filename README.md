###nodemailer-express

This repo is just a simple Node.js script demonstrating how to use [Nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/) with the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework.

**Caveat:** I'm not a Node.js expert by any means, so this might not be the best Node.js code out there. Still, it's functional and hopefully can help someone.
